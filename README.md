# 🌍 Urban Air Quality Prediction and Analysis Dashboard

##  Project Overview
The **Urban Air Quality Dashboard** is a data-driven project designed to **analyze, visualize, and forecast air quality (AQI)** across cities using **multi-source environmental, meteorological, and traffic data**.  

By leveraging **machine learning and deep learning models**, this dashboard predicts pollution levels, supports **real-time monitoring**, and provides valuable insights for decision-making in **urban sustainability, climate resilience, and public health management**.

Developed as part of the **MSDS692 – Data Science Practicum**, this project showcases the integration of data analytics, visualization, and AI-driven forecasting for smarter urban environments.

##  Objectives
- To integrate multi-source environmental and meteorological data for urban AQI prediction.  
- To design an **interactive Streamlit dashboard** for visualizing air quality patterns.  
- To compare predictive performance across **Random Forest, XGBoost, and LSTM** models.  
- To enable **real-time air quality monitoring** via the OpenWeatherMap API.  
- To promote awareness and provide data-driven decision support for pollution control.

##  Key Features
 **Dataset Analysis Mode**
- Analyze historical air quality data with interactive filters and date ranges.  
- Visualize pollutant patterns, correlations, and spatial intensity.  
- Train and compare predictive models for AQI forecasting.  

 **Real-Time Monitoring Mode**
- Fetch **live AQI and weather data** from the OpenWeatherMap API.  
- Display current pollutant concentrations and weather parameters.  
- Generate **short-term forecast charts** for the next 12–48 hours.  

 **Visualization Highlights**
- AQI trends over time  
- Correlation heatmaps  
- Traffic congestion vs pollution scatterplots  
- Pollution hotspot (geospatial) maps  
- Feature importance visualization  
- Model comparison and performance bar charts  
- Forecast line chart showing predicted AQI trends
